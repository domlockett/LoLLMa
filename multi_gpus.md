## Multi-GPU Setup Guide for Mixed GPU Environments (AMD & NVIDIA)

#### Step 1: Install HIP SDK
Install the HIP SDK to bridge the compatibility between AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. This tool helps adapt NVIDIA-focused applications to recognize and utilize AMD GPUs. Follow the installation instructions closely, ensuring that the HIP binaries are correctly integrated into your system's PATH. This setup is crucial for environments originally designed for CUDA.

#### Step 2: Verify Installation
Use command-line tools like `hipconfig` to check if both GPUs are recognized post HIP installation. This step confirms that the HIP environment is set up correctly.

#### Step 3: Application Configuration
Configure your applications to use the HIP SDK. This involves adjusting settings within the applications to ensure they can utilize the AMD GPU via HIP, akin to how they would interact with NVIDIA GPUs through CUDA.

#### Step 4: Monitor GPU Utilization
Regularly monitor your GPUs' performance to ensure both are being actively used. Tools like GPU-Z or the Windows Task Manager can provide real-time usage statistics.

#### Step 5: Stay Updated
Keep both your HIP SDK and GPU drivers up to date to take advantage of the latest features and performance improvements. This also helps in maintaining system stability and compatibility.
